Routes to the cgraph MCP tools (graph_query / graph_explain / graph_impact / graph_path / graph_context), which serve ranked file:line results, node neighborhoods, transitive blast radius, and token-budgeted source bundles from a resident per-project graph daemon in ~10ms — far cheaper than grepping and reading files. Prefer over blind grep/read for code navigation, dependency tracing, and impact analysis."

# cgraph

cgraph keeps a live, queryable graph of the current project — symbols (functions,
classes, types, files), their call/import/inheritance/containment edges, and
centrality ranking — served by a resident per-project daemon through MCP tools.

**Reach for these tools before grepping or reading files** when a question is
about code structure or relationships. A graph call is one ~10ms round-trip and
returns exactly the file:line (and often the source) you need, instead of many
grep/read calls that burn context.

## Routing: question → tool

| When the user / task needs… | Call |
| --- | --- |
| "Where is X? Find the symbol named …" | `graph_query` `{query}` — ranked by importance, each hit has `source_file` + `line` |
| "What is X? Show its callers/callees/imports" | `graph_explain` `{id}` — node + neighbors (each with `direction` and a navigable brief) + a source snippet |
| "What breaks if I change X? What depends on it?" | `graph_impact` `{id, direction:"dependents"}` — transitive blast radius, bounded by `max_depth` |
| "What does X rely on?" | `graph_impact` `{id, direction:"dependencies"}` |
| "How does A connect to B?" | `graph_path` `{source, target}` — shortest path, with `path_nodes` briefs |
| "Load context on X" / before editing or reviewing X | `graph_context` `{query or id, budget}` — focal node + most-relevant neighbors with snippets, packed to a token budget |
| "Verify the graph is current before I rely on it" | `graph_update {path:"."}` — blocking content-verified synchronization; returns `freshness.content_root`. Pin subsequent reads by passing the root as `expected_content_root`. |
| "Is the graph current? / I just changed files" | Nothing for ordinary reads — the daemon watches the tree and folds edits in within seconds. Use `graph_update` when you need a verified content_root to pin reads. |

## How to use the results

- `graph_query` matches case-insensitively and can be narrowed with `kind`
  (e.g. `"function"`, `"class"`, `"file"`), `file` (source-path substring), and
  `limit`. On zero matches it returns `suggestions` — the closest symbol names —
  so correct the spelling and retry instead of falling back to grep.
- Every id-taking tool (`graph_explain` / `graph_impact` / `graph_path` /
  `graph_context`) also accepts a bare symbol name (e.g. `"merge_fragments"`);
  the response echoes the canonical `id` it resolved. A miss comes back with
  `found: false` plus `suggestions`.
- `graph_query` returns ids and `source_file`:`line`. Open the file at `line`
  directly — no second search needed.
- `graph_explain` takes `direction` (`"in"` = callers/importers, `"out"` =
  callees/imports) and `limit`; neighbors are ordered most-important-first and
  `neighbor_count`/`truncated` flag when a hub has more edges than returned.
- `graph_context` is the highest-leverage call before an edit or review: ask for
  a budget (e.g. `4000`) and it returns the focal symbol's source plus its
  neighborhood's source, ranked and trimmed to fit. Read that instead of opening
  files one by one. It reports `omitted` / `truncated` if more existed.
- `graph_impact` with `dependents` is the safety check before changing a
  signature or deleting a symbol: it lists everything that would be affected,
  by depth.

## Freshness-sensitive navigation

When a task must rely on the graph being current with the worktree — before impact
analysis of a symbol you just moved, or after a batch of file edits — use the
synchronize-then-pin pattern:

```
1. update = graph_update {path: "."}
2. root = update.freshness.content_root
3. graph_query / graph_explain / graph_impact / graph_path / graph_context
       {…, expected_content_root: root}
```

`graph_update` is a blocking content-verified barrier: it hashes every detected
code file and re-extracts any whose content changed. The returned
`freshness.content_root` uniquely identifies that source snapshot. The response
also reports `files_hashed` and `bytes_hashed`. Passing the root as
`expected_content_root` on a subsequent read pins the response to the same
snapshot; the daemon returns an
error instead of graph data if it has published a different root since then.

Ordinary reads (without `expected_content_root`) do not scan the filesystem. They
read the latest published snapshot and return its `freshness` metadata; during
startup or for non-source seam graphs, `freshness.verified` can be `false`. The
daemon keeps source-backed snapshots current through automatic file watching.
Use synchronization and a pin when you need proof that the graph matches specific
source content.

## Practicalities

- The `cgraph` MCP server must be registered (it auto-spawns a per-project daemon
  keyed to the project root). The first tool call in a project triggers a
  one-time graph build (seconds), then queries are warm (~10ms).
- While that first build runs, results carry `"graph_state": "building"` — an
  empty result then means "not built yet", not "no match". Retry after a few
  seconds or poll `graph_status` until `build_state` is `"ready"`.
- The daemon watches the project tree (`graph_status` reports `watching`): file
  edits land in the graph automatically within a few seconds, and the graph is
  re-persisted in the background.
- Fall back to grep/read only when cgraph genuinely has no answer — e.g. a
  string literal, a comment, a config value, or a file type cgraph does not
  extract. For symbols and their relationships, prefer the graph.
- cgraph indexes code structure deterministically. Prose/doc relationships
  appear only if semantic enrichment fragments have been ingested; don't assume
  documentation concepts are present unless `graph_status` shows enrichment.
